## Architecture Overview

![alt text](image-1.png)

*In today’s digital age, building a scalable and secure web application is crucial for business success. The [AWS 3-Tier Web Application Architecture](https://www.ibm.com/topics/three-tier-architecture) stands out as a best practice for deploying cloud-based applications with efficiency and reliability. By leveraging [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/85cd2bb2-7f79-4e96-bdee-8078e469752a/en-US/part0/code) to create a three-tier architecture, businesses can achieve enhanced scalability, security, and performance. This architecture divides the application into three layers: the Web Tier, Application Tier, and Database Tier — each designed to handle specific tasks, ensuring seamless operation and optimal user experience. In this blog post, we’ll delve into how the AWS 3-Tier architecture can be leveraged to build resilient and high-performing web applications.

![None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*lrlYtzQsRPFOKH91PEPO2w.png)

After all the configuration we'll be having 6 subnets, As shown below:

![None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*tpKAHneT4ync8Q1qE4gZrA.png)

STEP 6: Create an internet Gateway, IGW is used to route traffic from internet to instance and vice versa, if all the newtork restrictions are allowed.

![None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*la67IfJr7cUyk3_IkAYYJw.png)

STEP 7: Attach this to the VPC which we just created above.

#### **CREATING SECURITY GROUPS**

In this section we will be creating security groups for all requirments. Security groups plays an integral part of the AWS security best practices, Regulating them can be benificial for you overall security.

1. ALB security group:
    

This allow's internet traffic to reach you ALB.

![None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*r_w4tVetqRYLl0xpAmrdEg.png)

2) Web Tier Security Group:

This allows traffic from ALB to web Tier.

![None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*W6zhGNK-C2YU_w-F_-0cdQ.png)

3) Internal LB SG:

There's an Internal ALB security group, which internally used for networking.

![None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*RMdLP2jX4DfHiWkRWOpxDg.png)

4) SG for private instance:

These allows only Certain IP(MY IP) to access the private instance.

![None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*Sng0RMfl_iG2hFiBK6Rxhg.png)

5) DB private SG:

This allows the DB to be accessible from the instance.

![None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*hkLVzlx_7oaI-BKMlevWnw.png)

#### **Creating Database**

In this Setup We are using RDS as a Database, In This secrion we'll be doing configurations related to the RDS intance.

STEP 1: Creating Subnet Group for RDS

![None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*j6qinhnt9yrn4jBFgb5mqA.png)

![None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*2fYJmmwJmQTuHQZY6P6wWw.png)

STEP 2: After Subnet Group create Database.We'll be creating a minimal setup of the RDS database as this is for testing purpose, you should not use this for a production setup.

![None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*ui6osOmpDFN-FMbYjJ3LMQ.png)

![None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*oxH3Oah5bQZW88PVI6PRDQ.png)

2) Using the Dev Test version for lesser costing.

![None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*ZyD0oleaqdkdS2wKBvLqdQ.png)

STEP 3: Create a solid Master password for your database access.
